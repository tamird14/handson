General Comment:
-----------------
The purpose of this task is to understand if we have a match for the offered position.
If you feel that any part of the task is not focused on demonstrating your skills,
please communicate it or even better, come with a better offer (:

Required Resources:
------------------
In order to take this exam you'll need a computer with jdk installed on it and an IDE of your choice.
You might/should/can use the internet.

Background:
----------
A Generator simulates a network that is being monitored by agents.
An agent can send events (io.alcide.handson.model.Event) with network activity information.

The Task:
--------
The task is to build the network topology from the events.
You are required to modify the code and implement the necessary parts in order to pass the failing tests.
Grade will take in consideration:
 1. Efficiency in processing the events and in querying the results.
 2. Use of proper technologies* (queues, DB, cache) where they are needed.
 3. Code quality: (OOP, clarity, logging, error handling etc.)

Technologies*: You are allowed to mock technologies but where you do please explain in a comment,
what technology are you mocking, why is it needed there and what will the "real" solution can do
that your mock doesnt. In addition keep the mocked API as close as possible to the real ones.
